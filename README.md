- Formats the menu with emojis and calorie information
- Sends it to the configured WhatsApp group
- The connection is persistent (saved in `auth_info` folder)

## Troubleshooting

- If the bot disconnects, it will automatically try to reconnect
- If you need to rescan the QR code:
  1. Delete the `auth_info` folder
  2. Restart the bot
- If the menu isn't being sent:
  1. Check your internet connection
  2. Verify the GROUP_JID in .env file
  3. Ensure you're still a member of the group
